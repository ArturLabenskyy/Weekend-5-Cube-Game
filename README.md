### About the rules
The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.
In each turn, a player rolls 2 dice as many times as he wishes.
Each result will get added to his round’s score.
But if the player rolls a double six all his round’s score gets lost.
After that, it's the next player’s turn.
A player can choose to ‘Hold’, which means that his round’s score gets added to his global score.
After that, it's the next player's turn.
The first player to reach 100 points wins.
